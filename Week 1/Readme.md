**In 2011, researchers at the Texas Transportation Institute and the Center for Transportation Research at UT Austin ran an advertising campaign aimed at recruiting Austin cyclists to join the South Congress Bike Mapping Project.  As members of the project, cyclists downloaded and used Cycle Tracks, a smartphone app developed by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority to track where people are riding their bikes based on their GPS points.  The goal was to gain new information about bike commuting patterns and this data set is based on the results of the study: 3600 trips tracked from 315 users over a 6 month period.   Data includes distances traveled, speed of travel, and reasons for travel among other variables.**
