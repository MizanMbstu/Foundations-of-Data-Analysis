### Over 1,200 bull riders from around the world are members of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). They compete in more than 300 PBR-affiliated bull riding events per year.In the American tradition, the rider must stay atop the bucking bull for a full eight seconds. This data set includes information about the top-ranked bull riders for 2013.  Rankings are based on a system which awards points for qualified rides at events throughout the season. 

## Primary Research Question 1
### For the 2013 season, Is there a linear relationship between how often a rider placed in the Top 10 and the number of times he stayed on his bull for a full 8 seconds?

### Conclusion 
There is a strong **positive** linear relationship between the number of 8-second rides a bull rider completed and the total number of times he made it in the Top 10 after the 2013 season, (r = **.917**).
The average number of rides for these bull riders was around **19**.There were no significant outliers. One rider appeared to have placed in the top-10 rankings only twice, despite an above-average number of rides. Upon closer inspection, we could see that he did not have a **very high** ride percentage which might account for his few appearances in the Top 10.



## Primary Research Question 2
### In 2012, what variable had the strongest linear relationship with Earnings:  Percentage rides or Cup points?

### Conclusion 
An initial examination of the relationships between Ride Percentage (RidePer) and Earnings, and Cup Points (CupPoints) and Earnings showed that Cup Points had the **stronger** relationship to Earnings. Ride Percentage and Earnings showed a correlation value of **0.6074** while Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of **0.7139**.Visual examination showedan 
**outlier**  in both relationships a rider who has earned over 1 million dollars. Removal of this increased the initial relationship: Ride Percentage and Earnings now had a correlation value of **0.8452** and Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of **0.9337**.Cup Points still had the higher relationship to Earnings. Visual examination showed a good **linear relationship** for both Ride Percentage and Cup Points, indicating the correct use of the correlation coefficient.
