## Conclusition 

The distribution of adult cats in the shelter is **roughly symmetric** with a **mean** of 8.6 pounds and a standard deviation of 
**1.9** pounds.

About 95% of adult cats at the shelter weigh between **4.8** and **12.4**pounds.
The distribution of adult dogs in the shelter is **positively skewed**, with a median of **35.3** pounds and an IQR of 
**40.4** pounds. Half of the dogs at the shelter do weigh much more, including one that weighs 
**131.00**
   ). As the two distributions are to be compared, and one distribution is skewed, the data shows that the median weight for both groups is 
**8.5**
   for cats and **35.3** for dogs.

A 13-pound cat 
would not
   be typical at the shelter. On the other hand, about 75% of all dogs at the shelter weigh more than 13 pounds.
   
Overall, the distributions of weights for adult cats and adult dogs at the shelter differ both in shape and in measures of center and spread. Cats generally weigh less and have 
less
   variation in their weights than dogs, while dogs tend to weigh more and have 
more
   variability.
